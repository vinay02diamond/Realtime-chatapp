Real-Time Chat Application

Overview

This project is a real-time chat application built using React.js for the frontend and Socket.IO for the backend. The application enables users to send and receive messages instantly, providing a seamless and interactive chat experience. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, handling socket connections and real-time communication. The frontend, built with React, offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for chatting.
